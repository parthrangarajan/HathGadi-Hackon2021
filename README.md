We all know about the economic hardships India is going through. Lockdown has forced all shops and businesses to halt for a long time now. This has lead to a lot of them closing down. Titled the "Retail Lockdown", the pandemic has caused over 7 lakh small shops to shut down according to The Economic Times.\

We feel most affected people are local vendors. **Why?**
1. No specific location to sell.They roam on the streets in search for customers. This is not allowed by various lockdown norms. We feel that by empowering them we will be empowering the economy of India.According to LiveMint **"Indian street vendors can become key enablers of economic growth and employment across urban landscapes"** and we share the same thoughts.
2. They cannot keep their businesses closed for long. Most of them have to feed themselves and theri families based on day-today earnings. 
3. They do not have refrigerators to prevent their goods from going bad. This means they have to incur losses from time to time.
4. More often than not hawkers do not have enough education to make a job switch which means they are either stuck at the same job for a very long or move to a buisness along more    lateral lines. 


We have come up with a solution. 
 - Roaming for Customers:
     - If customers know what they want to buy and the vendors know where they will find such customers, the vendors can make a trip to the locality deliver the goods, minimize           their labour all this while practising social distancing. 
 - Storage problem: 
    - If vendors know how much produce they need to carry with them everytime, it will not only reduce the donkey work but also improve productivity adn sustainence. It will             prevent from wastage and help local vendors to plan better.
 - Buisness Assurance:
    - The main point of this is to provide impetus to their buisness. If local vendors are visible to the people through the internet, the orders will flow in abundance therby           boosting the economy. 
   
 People have a means of direct communication with their wants and the supply for these wants. And this is the crux of our solution to the problem. HathGadi aims to provide an online presence to local vendors and to bridge these gaps that they have.
